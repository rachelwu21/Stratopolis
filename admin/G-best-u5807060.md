I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* Board

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of and implementation of running scores (line updateScore() in makeGUIPlacement,
* the function updateScore(), and a section in makeControls()), and placement previews
* (events pane.setOnMouseEntered and pane.setOnMouseExited) are by Manal Mohania.
* The idea and implementation of being able to rotate your piece by scrolling when you're
* hovering over the board was by Joseph Meltzer.
* (more detailed authorship comments in the class itself).

* The idea and implementation of making a sound whenever a placement is made
* was by Manal Mohania (though the mute button was by me, Zhixian Wu).

* All CSS styling of the buttons was done by Manal Mohania (some of it adapted off code
* credited in G-originality)

* The idea of being able to have two AIs play against each other was by Joseph Meltzer,
* and implemented by me.

* The code for all variations of 'addPane' (addPaneTwoPlayer, addPanePlayerGreen,
* addPanePlayerRed) in class Board if heavily adapted from:
* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31095954/how-to-get-gridpane-row-and-column-ids-on-mouse-entered-in-each-cell-of-grid-in>

* The image of the mute 'button' was from <https://pixabay.com/en/icon-loudspeaker-speaker-horn-1628258/>

* Some of the instructions were copied from <https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125022/stratopolis>
